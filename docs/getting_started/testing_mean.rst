Testing Mean
------------

Let's test drive our mean module

**mean.py**

  .. literalinclude:: ../../example/stat/stat/mean/mean_test.py
  :language: python
 
We did not attempt to access the constant ``bolztman``.
This is because variable defined with as constant 
are not accessible from fython. 

That's it for the mean module.
Now you can write a standalone Fython module.
In preparation for those days where you need more, let's see the variance module.

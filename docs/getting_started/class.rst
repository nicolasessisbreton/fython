Class
-------

Similar to Python, the first argument to any class method must be ``self``.
You can use any name for the self argument, 
the only rule is that the first argument is the self argument.

**class.fy**

    .. literalinclude:: ../../example/stat/stat/class/class.fy

Inheritance and spec interpolation are also possible.
See the language section for more details.

**class_test.py**

    .. literalinclude:: ../../example/stat/stat/class/class_test.py

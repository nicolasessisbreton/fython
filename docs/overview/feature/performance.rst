The Fython language is a syntaxtic binding for the Fortran language.
Any instruction you write in Fython is 
translated to Fortran, with the exact same meaning.
The translated Fortran code is then compiled to machine instructions.
There is no boiler plate code generation or LLVM in between.
What you code is what you run (WYCIWYR).

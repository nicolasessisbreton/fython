Declaration
-----------

The declarations order follows Fortran convention.
Variables, Classes and interface declaration shoud appear first
within a scoping unit, then functions.

A scoping unit is the entire module,
the body of a class, or the body of a function.

For this release, nested class or nested function are not supported.
